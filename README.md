This is a site I'm playing around with to practice CSS. I'm highly interested in CSS animations and love clean design. I was inspired by motion therapy videos online where people mash paint to mix colors, and wanted to create a digital version where you can hover over objects on the page and they'll move around.

I also wanted to include some site replications on this page to show that I can translate these skills into real life situations. 

## Technologies Used ###

- CSS3  
- HTML5 

## About the Build ### 

My school only touched lightly on CSS animations, so I was interested in diving deeper on my own. I know there are a lot of libraries out there that can build animations, but I wanted to make them on my own. I started looking up CSS animations online and took those concepts to build my own basic animations.
